----Already done work will not be hidden,   NEW uncommited code will be hidden ----
---- only new work will be hidden in that file----


I am a developer who is working on a otp login feature.
Now I have completed 75% of work.
But the client finds some bug in his application and now my manager asks me to work on that bug.
So now what to do with that uncommitedd changes?
We need to save it in a temporary area i.e stash

Git stash: The Git stash command can be used to accomplish this if a developer is working on a project 
and wants to preserve the changes without committing them. This will allow him to switch branches and 
work on other projects without affecting the existing modifications.


This is the new code added
